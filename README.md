## Description

Xulfus Tools is a BepInEx-based cheat for V Rising, offering advanced ESP visualization, aimbot functionality, and in-game assistance systems such as anti-counter mechanics.
Built on top of Unity’s IL2CPP and ECS architecture, the mod reads live entity data directly through BepInEx hooks, enabling precise and real-time overlays without manual DLL injection.

Key Features

ESP (Extra Sensory Perception):
Displays players, NPCs, Blood Carriers, and other important entities using efficient ECS entity queries.

Aimbot System:
Smooth aim assistance, target prioritization, and contextual behaviors designed to avoid triggering enemy counter skills.

Anti-Counter Mechanism:
Automatically detects when an enemy activates counter abilities and adjusts inputs accordingly—e.g., blocking actions or guiding the cursor away.

Authentication Layer:
Optional key-based access system with HWID locking and local server validation.

Xulfus Tools serves as a practical demonstration of ECS interaction, IL2CPP analysis, and gameplay assistant logic implemented through BepInEx for V Rising.
